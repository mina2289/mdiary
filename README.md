When importing git repo into Eclipse, first import as a general project. After the project get imported into the workspace, right click the project root and click "Configure" -> "Convert to Faceted Form". This it to convert a General project into a Java project. Now you should have an Eclipse Java project. The next thing is to configure the build path.
